## Feel free to add convoluted if-else statements for comedic effect. After all, more code means more laughs, right?

This project is intended for entertainment purposes only. It is not designed to be a serious AI application, and the results may be unpredictable and, frankly, nonsensical.

So, what are you waiting for? Join us on this journey of laughter and questionable coding practices!

P.S. We take no responsibility for any existential crises this program may cause. You have been warned.
